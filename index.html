							<p>
								I am a mathematics graduate student at the University of British Columbia researching the mathematics underlying the quantum Hall effect (which is where the background photo for this website comes from!). I am also a member of the Institute of Applied Mathematics. Fun fact: the quantization of the Hall resistance is so precise and experimentally repeatable that the Ohm is now defined as (a multiple of) one of these quantization units!  
							</p>
							<p>
								Besides physics, I am also passionate about machine learning and mathematical modelling. I have spent the past few years working summers (and also an 8 month contract) as an assistant physicist at C-Therm Technologies, a company in Fredericton, NB, Canada which delivers thermal analysis solutions. Probably my largest acheivement was being almost completely responsible for the software implementation of the mathematics/regression algorithm for their <a href="https://ctherm.com/thermal-conductivity-instruments/thermal-conductivity-kit/">Flex Transient Plane Source sensor</a>. I also contributed to multiple ongoing R&D projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								Beyond academics, I love playing guitar, watching hockey, and playing board games.

								<b>Detecting Outlier Goal Scoring in the NHL<a href="Detecting Outlier Goal Scoring in the NHL.html" target="_blank">(click here)</a></b><br>A personal machine learning project using data from <a href="https://moneypuck.com" target="_blank">moneypuck</a>. Uses LASSO, a random forest regressor, and a support vector regressor, ultimately all added to a stacking model, to attempt to learn how many goals a player "deserved to score" in any given season. One can then perform outlier detection; a player is considered an outlier if their goal totals differ drastically from the number of goals the model predicted they would score. The code outputs the top N over/underperformers for any given year, and compares their goal totals to the following season. Most of the time, the players which the model deemed overperformers score significantly less goals the following season, and similarly, underperformers tend to bounce back the following year. Open the file and scroll to the bottom of the page to see a plot of the results.

It's been a while since I've used this code, and I don't even have access to MATLAB anymore, so I can't guarantee anything (in fact, that goes for pretty much all the MATLAB code you find on this website). Although I do remember it making some very pretty animations!
