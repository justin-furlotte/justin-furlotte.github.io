							<p>
								I am a mathematics graduate student at the University of British Columbia researching the mathematics underlying the quantum Hall effect (which is where the background photo for this website comes from!). I am also a member of the Institute of Applied Mathematics at UBC.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am passionate about machine learning and mathematical modelling. In terms of industry experience, I have spent several summers, and also an 8 month term, as an assistant physicist at C-Therm Technologies, a company in Fredericton, NB, Canada which delivers thermal analysis solutions. My largest contribution was creating the regression algorithm for their <a href="https://ctherm.com/thermal-conductivity-instruments/thermal-conductivity-kit/">Flex Transient Plane Source sensor</a>. I also contributed to multiple ongoing R&D projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								Beyond academics, I love playing guitar, cooking, watching hockey, and playing board games.

								<b>Detecting Outlier Goal Scoring in the NHL <a href="https://outlierdetectionnhl.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">(click here (desktop))</a></b><br>(Warning: works best on desktop, and can sometimes be slow to load because Heroku's free service puts the dyno to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, and waking it can takes a minute). A personal machine learning project I've been chipping away at using data from <a href="https://moneypuck.com" target="_blank">moneypuck</a>. Uses LASSO, a random forest regressor, and a support vector regressor, ultimately all added to a stacking model, to attempt to learn how many goals a player "deserved to score" in any given season. One can then use this model to perform outlier detection; a player is considered an "overperformer" if they scored significantly more goals than the model predicted they would score, and similarly an "underperformer" is a player who scored much less than the model predicted. Often, the players which the model deemed as large "overperformers" scored significantly less goals the following season, and similarly, large "underperformers" tend to bounce back the following year. Click the link to open an application I built using my model and Plotly/Dash, deployed on Heroku. The code for the model can be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/justin-furlotte/NHL-Bounceback-Regression-Prediction" target="_blank">here</a>.

It's been a while since I've used this code, and I don't even have access to MATLAB anymore, so I can't guarantee anything (in fact, that goes for pretty much all the MATLAB code you find on this website). Although I do remember it making some very pretty animations!
