							<p>
								I am a mathematics graduate student at the University of British Columbia researching the mathematics underlying the quantum Hall effect. Fun fact: the quantization of the Hall resistance is so precise and experimentally repeatable that the Ohm is now defined as (a multiple of) one of these quantization units! I am also a member of the Institute of Applied Mathematics.  
							</p>
							<p>
								Besides physics, I am also passionate about machine learning and mathematical modelling. I have spent the past few years working summers (and also an 8 month contract) as an assistant physicist at C-Therm Technologies, a company in Fredericton, NB, Canada which delivers thermal analysis solutions. Probably my largest acheivement was being almost completely responsible for the software implementation of the mathematics/regression algorithm for their <a href="https://ctherm.com/thermal-conductivity-instruments/thermal-conductivity-kit/">Flex Transient Plane Source sensor</a>. I also contributed to multiple ongoing R&D projects.
							</p>
							<p>
								Beyond academics, I love playing guitar, watching hockey, and playing board games.

								<b><a href="Ising Model.pdf" target="_blank">2D Ising Model - Metropolis Algorithm Simulation</a></b><br>A neat little computational physics project which runs some Ising model magnetization simluations using the Metropolis algorithm. The MATLAB code can be downloaded <a href="IsingModel.m" target="_blank">here</a>, or copy and pasted from the end of the article. It's been a while since I've used this code, and I don't even have access to MATLAB anymore, so I can't guarantee anything. Although I do remember it making some very pretty animations!
